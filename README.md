# Xigncode-bypass
Feel free to modify that (module.json) to your info and upload it to your github (and spread it in TW community). I don't want to officially maintain xigncode-bypass anymore/advertise it in "Get More Mods", but I also don't  This mod is ready to use (requires latest version of toolbox!) and can be installed just like any other mod(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
